# File Compressor

Encoding and decoding schemes are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in music or video streaming,
data communications, storage systems (e.g., on CDs, DVDs, RAID arrays), among many others. In a *fixed-length encoding* each character is assigned a bit string of the same length. 

In this project I implemented a *variable-length encoding and decoding scheme*, and ran experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the the scheme for __*file compression*__ , in addition to the effciency of my algorithms.

## Input to the encoding algorithm 
The input to the encoding algorithm is a normal text (`.txt`) file that the user wishes to encode.

### Running the program from `cmd` line
 >> `encode insertion <ex1.txt >enex1.txt // encoding using INSERTION SORT algoritghm` <br>
 >> `encode merge <ex2.txt >enex2.txt // encoding using MERGE SORT algoritghm `
